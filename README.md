# 🎮 Gameplay Programmer Portfolio

Welcome to my interactive portfolio! This website is designed especially for gameplay programmers and game development enthusiasts who want to experience a unique and engaging presentation of my work and skills. 

## 🕹️ What is This Project?

This portfolio is more than just a showcase—it's a playground! 🌟  
It combines creativity, fun, and technology to show my passion for gameplay programming. You’ll find:

- **🎮 Mini-Games**: Try a bug-hitting hammer game right on the home page, and test your reflexes with a Snake game in the contact section.
- **✨ Animated Code Backgrounds**: Watch vibrant snippets of C++/Unreal Engine code gently float by, inspiring a techy and modern vibe.
- **🎨 Stylish Dark Theme**: Experience a sleek, GitHub-inspired design that's easy on the eyes and fully responsive for all devices.
- **🔊 Immersive Sound Effects**: Enjoy satisfying feedback every time you interact with the games or UI elements.

## 💡 Why Did I Build This?

I wanted my portfolio to *feel* like a game—not just look like one.  
Every part is intentionally crafted to demonstrate my abilities in JavaScript, game logic, UX/UI, and interactive design, as well as my love for fun and polish in everything I create.
